# eBirder-visualizations

## Potential visualization ideas

#### Phylogenetic tree
- Show a birder the percent of all families/orders that they have observed
- Show a birder the percent of each family/order that they have seen

#### Travel patterns of birders
- Show a birder their travel patterns in a given temporal scale
- Make a visualization of their birding trips in a given temporal scale

#### Submission patterns of birders?
- Show a birder their submissions over time to the eBird database
- Maybe color-coded by the different observation protocols (i.e., travelling, stationary, etc.)

## Initial steps
1. create small scale examples

2. place small scale examples into a workable web portal

3. once proof of concept is in place look for funding to scale it up a bit - maybe Cornell or some very wealthy birders (which do exist)
